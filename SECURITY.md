# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, open a private report via your hosting provider’s security advisories feature (preferred),
or contact the maintainer privately.

## Repo policy

- Never commit secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials, private keys).
- Avoid adding docs/examples that encourage insecure practices.
