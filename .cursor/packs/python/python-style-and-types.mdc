## Python style + types

- **Prefer readability over cleverness**; keep functions small and named for intent.
- **Typing**:
  - add type hints on new/changed public functions.
  - use `Optional[T]`/`T | None` appropriately and handle `None` explicitly.
- **Errors**:
  - raise specific exceptions; include actionable messages.
  - don’t swallow exceptions without logging or rethrowing.
- **Imports**: keep ordered and minimal; avoid unused imports.
