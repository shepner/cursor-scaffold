## Docs quality bar

- **Prefer concise structure**: headings, short sections, bullets over long paragraphs.
- **Be concrete**: include examples/commands people can run; avoid vague guidance.
- **Keep “what/why/how”**:
  - what it does
  - why it exists
  - how to use it (minimal steps)
- **Link or reference** the canonical source if it exists (README, ADR, upstream docs).
