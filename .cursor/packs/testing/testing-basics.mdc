## Testing basics

- **Write tests for new behavior** (or bug fixes) where failure would be costly or non-obvious.
- **Use AAA**: Arrange → Act → Assert.
- **Test edge cases**: empty inputs, missing fields, boundaries, invalid formats, error paths.
- **Keep tests deterministic**:
  - control time, randomness, and external I/O via fakes/mocks/fixtures
  - avoid network calls in unit tests
- **Avoid shared global state** between tests; keep setup/teardown explicit.
- **Name tests for intent**: what behavior is expected, not implementation details.
