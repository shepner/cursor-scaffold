## Standard library first (dependency discipline)

- **Before adding a dependency**, check whether the standard library (or existing deps) already cover the need well enough.
- **Justify new dependencies**:
  - why stdlib isn’t sufficient
  - why this library (maturity, maintenance, security posture)
  - expected surface area (where it will be used)
- **Prefer fewer, well-chosen dependencies** over many micro-deps.
- **Pin and document** runtime-critical dependencies and any security-sensitive ones.
