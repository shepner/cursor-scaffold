## Logging (quality bar)

- **Use log levels intentionally**:
  - ERROR for failures that need attention
  - WARN for degraded behavior
  - INFO for normal operations and milestones
  - DEBUG for developer diagnostics
- **Include context**: component/module, request/job identifiers, counts, durations.
- **Prefer structured logs** when feasible (key/value fields) so logs are searchable.
- **Never log secrets**: credentials, tokens, full auth headers, private keys, or sensitive payloads.
- **Avoid noisy logs** in hot loops; aggregate counts and log summaries.
