# Self-documenting workflows

This project uses Cursor to continually document and improve its own workflows.
All Cursor-for-Cursor artifacts live under `.cursor/` (rules, skills, notes, helpers, packs).

## When to document or improve

- After a non-trivial or repeatable workflow, add/update a rule/skill/helper.
- When you notice gaps or repeated friction, codify it.

## What to create or update

- Rules: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
- Packs: `.cursor/packs/<pack>/*.mdc` (source material for other repos)
- Skills: `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Notes: `.cursor/notes/`
- Helpers: `.cursor/helpers/`
